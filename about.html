          <hr>
          <p>I’m Seth Harmer, out of Sydney, Australia.</p>

          <p>I am currently studying Web Design and this website is my portfolio, also my first project to test the things I have learnt thus far. I started to pursue IT in 2014 by gaining a certification in Network Administration, and have since worked numerous support roles within the industry. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and to learn something new, which is what brought me to Web Design.</p>

          <p>In my spare time I love to play video games, which all began with the Nintendo 64 in 1998. Picking up the guitar occasionally passes the time, but getting out for a beer on the weekends is always a plus, just as long as it’s a VB (the Very Best).</p>
